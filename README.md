# Nestly

A tiny, single-word, daily journaling app with a moody little bird.
Write once a day, keep your streak, beat the midnight clock.

Features

One-a-day journaling overlay with bite-sized prompts

Streaks tracked locally (no accounts, no backend)

Flip-clock countdown to upcoming midnight

Bird moods that worsen as midnight approaches (happy → neutral → annoyed → pissed)
and snap to happy after you complete the day

Random bird positions that avoid the center timer/caption/button (no-fly zone)

Randomized captions per mood for variety

Offline-friendly (pure HTML/CSS/JS, data in localStorage)

Accessible: aria-live for streak/timer; overlay is a proper dialog
